          My name is Dairon Ferrer. I am twenty-years-old and I am currently attending UNC Chapel Hillâ€™s Coding Bootcamp, which upon completion will introduce me into the software development work field. I have always had a passion for technology and its advancements, so I am hoping to turn my interests into my life-long career. Once graduated from UNC I will be certified as a full-stack developer and will possess the skills needed to succeed in this field.

        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work in the shipping department at Ashley Furniture while I am in school, but my desire to succeed and have multiple skills have pushed me to work different jobs prior to this one. I am a freelancing medical interpreter, where I use my proficiency in both English and Spanish to communicate with patients and doctors during visits to the clinic. I have also displayed my interpersonal skills by working as a Sales Associate at Sherwin-Williams, where I interacted with business clients and wholesale customers. My performances at any workplace have always been far above what is expected, and my mentality remains the same with the new skills I will acquire in order to enter this new work field.
